# Food-Demand-Forecasting-Using-Time-series-analysis-LSTM-model-
This project implements a deep learning model to forecast weekly food demand at fulfillment centers using historical sales and metadata. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in PyTorch, it captures temporal patterns in time-series data to improve prediction accuracy.
